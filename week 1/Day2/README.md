## üî¨ Understanding Timing Libraries (`.lib`)

Timing libraries are critical files that characterize the performance (delay, power, etc.) of standard cells for a specific semiconductor process.

### The SKY130 Open Source PDK

The SKY130 Process Design Kit (PDK) is a comprehensive, open-source toolkit for SkyWater Technology's 130nm process. It provides all the necessary files, including the timing libraries, required for designing integrated circuits.

### Decoding the Library Naming Convention

The filename `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib` contains information about the conditions under which the cells were characterized:
-   **`tt`**: Represents the **Typical-Typical** process corner, meaning nominal manufacturing conditions.
-   **`025C`**: Specifies an operating **temperature of 25¬∞C**.
-   **`1v80`**: Denotes a **supply voltage of 1.8V**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Synthesis Strategies: Hierarchical vs. Flattened

Synthesis tools can interpret your RTL design in two primary ways.

### The Hierarchical Approach

This method preserves the design's modular structure as defined in your Verilog files. Each module is synthesized as a separate entity.

* **Benefits**:
    * Faster compilation times for complex designs.
    * Makes debugging easier since the final netlist maps clearly to the original RTL.
    * Promotes a modular and organized design flow.
* **Drawbacks**:
    * Optimizations are confined within module boundaries and cannot occur across them.

### The Flattened Approach

This approach dissolves all module boundaries, merging the entire design into a single, large netlist before optimization.

* **Benefits**:
    * Enables powerful, global optimizations across the entire logic of the design.
    * Can potentially lead to better area and timing results.
* **Drawbacks**:
    * Significantly increases synthesis runtime and memory usage.
    * The link to the original RTL structure is lost, making debugging very difficult.

### Comparison at a Glance

| Characteristic      | Hierarchical Synthesis              | Flattened Synthesis                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Design Structure**| Preserved from RTL        | Collapsed into one netlist|
| **Optimization** | Local (within modules)    | Global (across the full design)|
| **Compile Time** | Faster                    | Slower                    |
| **Debugging Ease** | High (easy to trace)      | Low (difficult to trace)  |

If we have same multiple modules or if we have a massive design where we want to divide and conquer then we synthesize an individual sub module:
```verilog
synth -top sub_module1
```
